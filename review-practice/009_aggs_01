# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: AGGREGATIONS **
# GOAL: Create metrics, bucket, and pipeline aggregations
# REQUIRED SETUP: 
# (i)  a running Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node and a 
#      Kibana instance,
# (ii) add the "Sample flight data" to Kibana
### Run the next queries on the `kibana_sample_data_flights` index

# Create an aggregation named "max_distance" that calculates the 
#    maximum value of the `DistanceKilometers` field

# Create an aggregation named "popular_carriers" that calculates the 
#   number of flights grouped by the `Carrier` field
# Add a sub-aggregation to "popular_carriers", named 
#   "carrier_stats_delay", that computes stats over the value of the 
#   `FlightDelayMin` field for the related bucket of carriers
# Add a second sub-aggregation to "popular_carriers", named
